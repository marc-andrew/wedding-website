Grunt Template for Front End Devs
==============

Before you start you will need NodeJS + Node Packages, GruntJS and SASS.


### First, install node.js

Grunt needs [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to work. If you don't have it yet, [download the current version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (not the LTS) and install it. 
Node comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the node package manager, which you will use to install packages.


### Install Grunt

Open up a terminal window and type in the command below

```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

The “-g” in the command above will install grunt globally, so we can use it everywhere. 
Sudo will run the command as an administrator. You can skip the “sudo” part if you are using a windows machine.


### Install SASS

You will need [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to write the CSS.

In terminal window type in the command below

```
sudo npm install -g sass
```

The “-g” in the command above will install grunt globally, so we can use it everywhere. 
Sudo will run the command as an administrator. You can skip the “sudo” part if you are using a windows machine.


### Install Packages

Now you will need to get all node packages.
Open the folder in your terminal window and type in the command below

```
npm install
```
